## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- JDK 17 or later
- Android SDK 26 or later
- Git
- Basic knowledge of Kotlin and Android development
- Understanding of Jetpack Compose (preferred)
- Familiarity with MVVM architecture pattern

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Musika.git
   cd Musika
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/jed1boy/Musika.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### 1. Environment Setup

1. **Install Android Studio** with the latest Android SDK
2. **Set up local.properties**:
   ```bash
   cp local.properties.template local.properties
   ```
   Edit `local.properties` and add your Android SDK path:
   ```properties
   sdk.dir=/path/to/your/Android/sdk
   ```
   
   > **IMPORTANT**: Never commit your `local.properties` file to the repository as it contains local configuration specific to your development environment. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude this file.

### 2. Firebase Setup (Optional)

If you want to test Firebase features:

1. Create a Firebase project
2. Add Android apps with package names:
   - `com.musika.app` (release)
   - `com.musika.app.debug` (debug)
3. Copy the template and configure it with your Firebase credentials:
   ```bash
   cp app/google-services.json.template app/google-services.json
   ```
4. Edit `app/google-services.json` with your Firebase project details

> **IMPORTANT**: Never commit your actual `google-services.json` file to the repository as it contains sensitive API keys. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude this file.

## Handling Sensitive Information

When contributing to Musika, it's crucial to handle sensitive information properly:

### Files That Should Never Be Committed

1. **local.properties**
   - Contains your local SDK path
   - Use the provided template (`local.properties.template`) instead

2. **google-services.json**
   - Contains Firebase API keys and project credentials
   - Use the provided template (`app/google-services.json.template`) instead

3. **Build outputs**
   - Never commit `.apk`, `.aab`, `.class`, or other build artifacts
   - These are automatically excluded by `.gitignore`

4. **IDE-specific files**
   - Most `.idea/` directory contents should not be committed
   - Only commit IDE configuration files that are essential for project setup

### Best Practices

- **API Keys**: Never hardcode API keys in the source code
- **Credentials**: Never include usernames, passwords, or tokens in commits
- **Personal Information**: Remove any personal information before committing
- **Before Committing**: Always review your changes to ensure no sensitive information is included
- **If Accidentally Committed**: If you accidentally commit sensitive information, contact a project maintainer immediately

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### 4. Security Considerations

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit sensitive files to the repository:

- `google-services.json` - Contains Firebase API keys
- `local.properties` - Contains local development paths
- `*.keystore` / `*.jks` - App signing keys
- `secrets.properties` - API keys and secrets
- `**/assets/po_token.html` - YouTube authentication tokens

These files are automatically ignored by `.gitignore` but always double-check before committing.
