# Changelog

All notable changes to Echo Music will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.3.3] - 2026-01-06
- **Local Media Scanner**: Added ability to scan and import locally stored music files via the Content settings.
- **Manual Lyrics Fix**: Fixed an issue where manually selected lyrics were overwritten by auto-fetched lyrics.

## [3.1.3] - 2025-11-22
- Fixed a database migration issue.  
  The schema was at version 25, but only a **1 → 2** migration was defined.  
  Any install starting from another version had no valid upgrade path, causing the app to crash during migration.  
  All required migration steps are now in place so upgrades work correctly across versions.
